# Development Rules for Cedar Policy Repository

## Pre-Commit Checklist

### MANDATORY: Test with Act Before Push

**ALWAYS** run Act locally before committing and pushing changes that affect GitHub Actions:

```bash
# Test the validate job
act -j validate

# If you modified the deployment workflow
act -j deploy --secret-file .env.act
```

### When to Use Act

You MUST use Act when:
- Modifying `.github/workflows/*.yml` files
- Changing scripts called by GitHub Actions
- Updating CloudFormation templates
- Modifying policy upload logic

### Act Testing Commands

```bash
# Basic validation test
act -j validate

# Test with verbose output
act -j validate -v

# Test specific event
act push -b

# Test pull request workflow
act pull_request
```

### If Act is Not Available

If Docker/Act is not available, use the mock runner as a minimum:
```bash
./scripts/mock-gha.sh
```

## Other Development Rules

1. **Policy Changes**: Always run `./scripts/quick-validate.sh` before committing
2. **Script Changes**: Test with `./scripts/run-all-tests.sh`
3. **Documentation**: Update relevant docs when changing functionality
4. **Clean Commits**: One logical change per commit

## Consequences

Pushing untested changes that break CI/CD:
- Blocks deployments for the entire team
- Requires hotfix commits
- Wastes CI/CD minutes
- Reduces confidence in the codebase

Remember: 2 minutes of local testing saves 30 minutes of debugging!
